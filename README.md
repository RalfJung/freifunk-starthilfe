Freifunk Starthilfe
===================

Goal:
	A script that retrieves two arguments the source and destination folder and copies, renames the freifunk firmware files in the source to a tftp-flashable format in the destination.

Design:
	Script is for now meant to be written in Python and consist of a dictionary where the lookup is done and a simple script that renames and moves the files.
